# ws-checkpoint

[中文版](README_zh.md)

Btrfs-based workspace snapshot system for AI Agents. ws-checkpoint is a runtime component of [ANOLISA](../../README.md) that provides filesystem-level checkpoint and rollback; latency depends on the filesystem, workload, and host environment.

## Features

- **Copy-on-write snapshots** — uses btrfs COW for efficient checkpoint and rollback; latency depends on the filesystem and workload
- **Daemon architecture** — privileged operations run in a daemon; CLI clients need no root
- **Unix Socket IPC** — bincode binary protocol for high-performance communication
- **systemd integration** — RPM one-click deploy, auto-start on boot
- **Snapshot listing** — table/json output formats
- **Diff between snapshots** — view file changes between any two checkpoints
- **Runtime status monitoring** — daemon and workspace health at a glance
- **Auto-cleanup** — daemon-side scheduled cleanup by count or age retention
- **TOML config hot-reload** — single config entry at `/etc/ws-ckpt/config.toml`, `ws-ckpt reload` applies instantly
- **Capacity alerting** — warns when any workspace exceeds 1000 snapshots or 90% filesystem usage

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Linux (Alinux 4 recommended)
- btrfs filesystem
- Rust 1.70+

The workspace root must not be an active mount point. Initialization moves the
original directory aside as a backup, and `rename(2)` fails with `EBUSY` on a
directory that is itself a mount point — most often an in-place SkillFS mount.
Unmount it (`skillfs stop <PATH>`, or `fusermount3 -u <PATH>`) before `init` or
the first `checkpoint`.

### Build

```bash
cd src
cargo build --release
```

### Install (RPM)

```bash
# Build RPM
./build-rpm.sh

# Install
sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ws-ckpt-*.rpm

# Start service
sudo systemctl start ws-ckpt
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a workspace
ws-ckpt init --workspace ~/my-workspace

# Create a checkpoint
ws-ckpt checkpoint --workspace ~/my-workspace -s initial -m "initial version"

# Create another checkpoint after changes
ws-ckpt checkpoint --workspace ~/my-workspace -s feature -m "add feature"

# Preview rollback
ws-ckpt rollback --workspace ~/my-workspace -s initial --preview

# Rollback to a snapshot
ws-ckpt rollback --workspace ~/my-workspace -s initial

# Delete a snapshot
ws-ckpt delete --workspace ~/my-workspace -s feature
```

### Snapshot Management

```bash
# List all snapshots
ws-ckpt list --workspace ~/my-workspace

# JSON output
ws-ckpt list --workspace ~/my-workspace --format json

# Read one explicit page (oldest first); output includes next_cursor
ws-ckpt list --workspace ~/my-workspace --limit 1000 --format json

# Continue that explicit page
ws-ckpt list --workspace ~/my-workspace --limit 1000 --cursor '<next_cursor>' --format json

# Diff between two snapshots
ws-ckpt diff --workspace ~/my-workspace --from msg1-step1 --to msg1-step2

# Diff snapshot vs current working tree (omit --to)
ws-ckpt diff --workspace ~/my-workspace --from msg1-step1

# Cleanup old snapshots, keep latest 5
ws-ckpt cleanup --workspace ~/my-workspace --keep 5
```

After interrupted cleanup, restart reconciles missing ordinary snapshots and
pins recovered orphans until explicitly deleted. Query them with
`ws-ckpt list -w <workspace> --orphans --format json`, then delete selected full
IDs with `ws-ckpt delete -w <workspace> -s <complete-id> --force`. Delete no longer
accepts prefixes. Missing pinned snapshots and guarded evidence remain unavailable;
deleting an absent target returns `SnapshotNotFound`. Upgrade CLI and daemon together.
See [snapshot recovery](../../docs/user-guide/en/runtime/ws-ckpt.md#snapshot-recovery-after-an-interrupted-cleanup).

### Recovering interrupted initialization

Recovery confirmation uses the daemon-resolved workspace and snapshot count.
If the recovery target or snapshot set changes before execution, confirm again.
Update the CLI and daemon together to use this confirmation protocol.

`ws-ckpt recover -w <workspace> --force` also handles an unregistered workspace:
it restores `.pre-init-bak` and retains migrated subvolumes for inspection.
Successful registered recovery archives leftover backups without blocking the
next `init`. If a
registered workspace's live subvolume was deleted externally, use
`ws-ckpt unregister -w <workspace> --force` to remove its stale registration;
this restores no data and preserves snapshots and backups. For both commands,
`--force` only skips interactive confirmation. See the
[recovery guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/runtime/ws-ckpt.md#recovering-interrupted-initialization-and-stale-registrations).

### Configuration

Configuration has two layers: **global** (`/etc/ws-ckpt/config.toml`, daemon-wide defaults) and **local** (`/var/lib/ws-ckpt/indexes/<ws_id>/policy.toml`, per-workspace override). The `ws-ckpt config` subcommand scope:

- No scope flag: prints read-only overview (global config + workspace override stats)
- `-g` / `--global`: view or modify the global config file
- `-w <workspace>` / `--workspace <workspace>`: view or modify a workspace's `policy.toml`

```bash
# View system status
ws-ckpt status --workspace ~/my-workspace

# View global config
ws-ckpt config -g

# Enable periodic auto-cleanup (global)
ws-ckpt config -g --enable-auto-cleanup

# Global retention policy (by count or age)
ws-ckpt config -g --auto-cleanup-keep 10
ws-ckpt config -g --auto-cleanup-keep 30d

# Per-workspace override (only auto_cleanup / auto_cleanup_keep)
ws-ckpt config -w ~/my-workspace                       # 3-column view: effective / local / global
ws-ckpt config -w ~/my-workspace --auto-cleanup-keep 5
ws-ckpt config -w ~/my-workspace --disable-auto-cleanup
ws-ckpt config -w ~/my-workspace --reset               # Remove local policy.toml, inherit global

# Hot-reload after manual config edits
ws-ckpt reload
```

`config -g` writes the global file, then verifies the daemon reloaded the same settings — it exits non-zero and lists any field that differs. In a Kubernetes sidecar deployment the CLI and daemon run in separate containers, so `/etc/ws-ckpt` must be on a volume shared by both, or global settings will not reach the daemon.
