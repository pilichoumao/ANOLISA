# Documentation regression check for the Tokenless install methods.
#
# The install docs describe four production paths (anolisa CLI, npm, curl, Skill)
# whose prerequisites, adapter-enablement steps and platform support differ.
# These assertions keep the docs tied to what scripts/install.sh actually does,
# so a doc cannot drift back into claiming prerequisites, adapter commands or
# platform support that the execution path does not provide.
