# Regression test for the detect.sh first-run settling retries.
#
# Background: GH #2512 reported test_detect_installed_framework_ready
# [claude-code] flaking in nightly runs. The reported cause was a
# filesystem/PATH initialization timing race on the first detect.sh
# execution right after provisioning: the claude binary under
# $HOME/.local/bin and the $HOME/.claude state dir are transiently
# invisible. #2512 itself was closed as a test-side flaky misclassification
# (issuecomment-5288391676), but the detect.sh-side weakness it exposed is
# real, and only one exit-status-affecting check can actually race: the
# claude binary lookup. A binary that is not yet visible makes detect.sh
# exit 2 ("missing prerequisites"), which is exactly what turns a
# "framework ready" assertion into a failure. (The $HOME/.claude config-dir
# probe is informational only and never changes the exit status.)
#
# Scenario 1 therefore reproduces that real failure path: the claude binary
# becomes visible in $HOME/.local/bin only after a delay (simulated with a
# background provisioner), and $HOME/.claude does not exist until the CLI's
# first `plugin list`. With settling retries, detect.sh must ride out the
# race and report ready (exit 0); without retries (scenario 2) the same
# first execution must fail with exit 2, proving the retries are what fix
# it. The remaining scenarios pin the plugin probe's retry semantics.
#
# GH #3082 reported a second, distinct first-run race: `claude plugin
# install` writes the marketplace/plugin manifests, but the CLI's plugin
# registry index only picks them up on a later scan, so the very first
# `plugin list` right after provisioning succeeds (exit 0) and still omits
# the just-installed plugin. detect.sh used to treat that omission as
# definitive and report "not installed" (exit 1) on the first run, while the
# second run correctly reported ready. It now re-lists that one case a
# bounded number of times (scenarios 4-5), but only while the local
# manifests are staged — with nothing on disk for the installer to have
# registered, the omission really is definitive and must not spend any
# budget (scenario 6). Scenario 3 pins the cost of that re-listing in the
# ordinary pre-install state, and scenario 7 keeps the pre-existing rule
# that an outright failing `plugin list` is transient and is retried.
#
# GH #3267 is that same race recurring under load: the #3082 fix bounded the
# re-lists by count alone (2 of them, ~2s apart), and registry-index lag is a
# wall-clock phenomenon, so on a host busy with a concurrent full build the
# index outlasts those 2 attempts and the false "not installed" verdict comes
# back. The re-list loop is therefore bounded by a wall-clock window as well
# as by an attempt count, whichever ends first, and backs off between
# attempts. Scenario 8 pins the lag that outlived the old budget and that the
# shipped default now rides out; scenario 9 is its control at the old budget;
# scenario 10 pins the window as an independent bound; scenario 11 pins the
# exponential backoff and its ceiling; scenario 12 pins the backoff being
# clamped to the time left in the window; scenario 13 pins the window being a
# deadline for the retries nested inside a re-list too, so an omission that
# turns into a failing CLI cannot run the probe past it; scenario 14 pins that
# a clamped backoff whose sleep the host ran long past the window buys no new
# attempt, which is scenario 12's boundary attempt waking up late.
#
# The backoff is asserted by stubbing `sleep` and reading the delays it was
# asked for, never by measuring elapsed time: a timing assertion would flake
# on exactly the loaded hosts this fix targets.
#
# detect.sh reads the manifests and the hook dispatcher from
# $ANOLISA_ADAPTER_DIR, so every scenario points it at a synthetic adapter
# tree the test controls; no scenario depends on the state of the checked-out
# source tree (whether plugin.json has been stamped, for instance).

# --- Scenario 13: the window bounds the retries nested in a re-list too -----
# The omission-then-transient-failure sequence: the first `plugin list`
# succeeds but omits the plugin (the GH #3082 registry lag), and every list
# after that fails outright — what a contended host looks like once the CLI
# starts failing part-way through a re-list. Given a 1s window, a 1s retry
# delay and 3 retries, a probe whose nested retries ignore the deadline keeps
# going after the clamped backoff has already spent that window: it issues 5
# list calls about a second apart and returns only after ~4s, four times the
# window it is documented to respect. Sharing one deadline between the re-list
# loop and the retries nested in it caps the probe at the initial list plus
# the single attempt that the clamped backoff bought.
#
# Asserted from what the probe asked for — the list calls it made and the
# sleeps it requested — rather than from elapsed time, so the scenario cannot
# flake on a loaded runner. The summed request is the wall-clock bound the
# window promises: a probe that never sleeps longer than its window cannot
# overrun it by more than the one call already in flight.

# --- Scenario 14: a clamped backoff that wakes late buys no attempt ---------
# The clamp decides how long detect.sh asks to wait, not how long a contended
# host actually waits: its timer can fire well after the requested delay.
# Scenario 12 pins the on-time case, where the sleep the clamp paid for does
# get its one boundary attempt. Here the same knobs — a 30s backoff clamped to
# a 3s window — wake up 3s late instead, so the window closed about 3s ago and
# the attempt would be a *brand new* `plugin list`, not an invocation already
# in flight being allowed to finish. It must not start: being the sleep the
# clamp shortened is not a licence on its own, the wake-up time decides.
#
# The window is scenario 12's 3s rather than the tightest one that still
# clamps, because $SECONDS counts whole seconds and the re-list loop reads it
# twice: once to decide whether the window is still open, then again — after
# two awk spawns — to clamp the backoff against what is left of it. Under a 1s
# window a host that spends that second on the initial `plugin list` leaves the
# loop either nothing to clamp, so it requests 0.000s, or no loop at all, and
# both read as a failure here even though detect.sh did the right thing. Three
# ticks of margin is what scenario 12 already runs on. For the same reason the
# sleep count and the requested delay are bounds, not exact values: the strict
# invariant is the call count, and it holds either way, because a clamped sleep
# of `left` plus 3s of lateness lands at least 3s past a deadline whose slack
# is 1s — far enough past it that the wake-up rule must deny the attempt no
# matter how much of the window the host had already spent.
