# Full TOON functional verification.
# Covers three application scenarios: Tokenless CLI, Cosh-NG, OpenClaw.
#
# Run by hand (this is not a make target):
#
#   PATH="src/tokenless/target/debug:$PATH" bash src/tokenless/tests/test-toon-full.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   required    tokenless on PATH built from this checkout (set
#               TOKENLESS_ALLOW_VERSION_SKEW=1 to accept an installed one), jq, python3
#   scenario 2  common hooks directory, taken from the repo tree by default and
#               overridable with TOKENLESS_HOOK_DIR
#   scenario 3  OpenClaw with the tokenless plugin installed and enabled, GNU timeout
#               (coreutils), and an explicit TOKENLESS_TOON_FULL_LIVE=1
#               (3.x makes real model calls: slow and quota-consuming, off by default).
#               The OpenClaw state directory resolves as OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR ->
#               OPENCLAW_HOME -> ~/.openclaw, the same way the adapter install/detect
#               scripts do it, and OPENCLAW_BIN overrides the CLI path. With live mode
#               on, a missing scenario 3 prerequisite aborts the run instead of
#               reporting a green suite that validated nothing.
#
#               Every OpenClaw call, the read-only probe included, is bounded with
#               timeout; without it no OpenClaw call is issued at all (the probe falls
#               back to the on-disk plugin directory) and a live run aborts up front
#               rather than hanging in the probe. Under live mode a session query that
#               fails, times out or returns unparseable output counts as a failure -
#               only a successful query that lists no session is a skip.
#
# A missing optional prerequisite is recorded as SKIP rather than FAIL: this script has
# to reach a trustworthy verdict on dev machines, CI containers and provisioned hosts
# alike. A permanently red case only gets ignored, and it rots together with the
# contract it was supposed to cover.
