# Tokenless Quick Start

[中文版](../../../zh/token-saving/tokenless/QUICKSTART.md)

Install Tokenless, connect it to Claude Code, run one real task, and verify a
before/after Token record in about three minutes. Tokenless works in the
background, so your prompts and normal Agent workflow do not change.

Savings vary by workload. Tool-heavy tasks usually show the clearest result;
short or conversation-only tasks may show little change.

## 1. Install Tokenless and connect Claude Code {#install-tokenless}

Choose an installation method based on your use case:

| Method | Use case | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [anolisa CLI](#method-a-anolisa-cli-recommended) | Full ANOLISA component management | Unified management of all components and adapters |
| [RPM](#rpm-alinux) | Alinux with the YUM repository configured | Managed package through `yum`, then adopted into anolisa system state |
| [npm](#method-b-npm) | Standalone CLI and adapter install | Prebuilt binaries + adapter resources for developers |
| [curl](#method-c-curl-standalone-install) | One-liner on Linux or macOS | Uses npm when available (needs Node.js 16.7+), otherwise builds from source (needs a Rust toolchain) |
| [Skill](#method-d-skill-for-agents) | Agent-driven install | Skill-based installation for agent frameworks |

### Method A: anolisa CLI (recommended)

This quick path uses Claude Code as the example Agent:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.agentic-os.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
anolisa install tokenless
anolisa adapter enable tokenless claude-code
```

If the anolisa CLI is already installed, start with `anolisa install
tokenless`. The PATH line is needed only when a fresh installation reports
that `~/.local/bin` is not available in the current Shell.

Using another Agent? Follow the matching setup path in
[Use another Agent](#use-another-agent); the remaining steps stay the same.
The Agents listed below use `anolisa adapter enable`, including OpenCode.
OpenCode also provides a bundled lifecycle script for npm or manual installations.

### RPM (Alinux) {#rpm-alinux}

Alinux users with the YUM repository configured may install the managed RPM
instead of running the CLI installer:

```bash
sudo yum install anolisa tokenless
sudo anolisa --install-mode system adopt tokenless
```

`adopt` records the directly installed RPM in system state, so the adapter
commands can use its component contract. Upgrades and removal go through `yum`;
see [Troubleshooting · YUM/RPM installation](troubleshooting.md#yumrpm-installation).

The methods below install the CLI on their own and create no anolisa component
record, so `anolisa adapter enable` does not apply to them.

### Method B: npm

Requires Node.js 16.7+ — that is the release `fs.cpSync` arrived in, and the package postinstall uses it to place the adapter resources. Automatically installs the prebuilt binaries (`tokenless`, `rtk`) and the framework adapter resources for your platform:

```bash
npm install -g anolisa-tokenless
tokenless --version
```

After installation, the adapter resources are located at `~/.local/share/anolisa/adapters/tokenless/`. An npm install creates no anolisa component record, so `anolisa adapter enable` does not apply to it — enable adapters as described in [Enable the adapter for your install method](#enable-the-adapter-for-your-install-method).

That directory is shared with the anolisa CLI. When it already belongs to a managed component install, the package postinstall keeps it unchanged and says so instead of replacing resources a component record still refers to; pass `ANOLISA_TOKENLESS_FORCE_ADAPTERS=1` to take it over anyway. This protection ships in the first npm release built from the change described on this page: published packages up to and including `0.8.2` predate it and replace that directory unconditionally, so back up a managed adapter tree before installing one of them (check with `npm view anolisa-tokenless version`).

The postinstall also enables the `claude-code` adapter: it runs that adapter's own `install.sh`, which registers the plugin with the Claude CLI when one is reachable (`CLAUDE_BIN` selects which). With no Claude CLI it skips registration and says so rather than failing the install. That registration lives in Claude's own configuration — outside the npm prefix and outside the adapter directory — so removing the package does not by itself remove it.

**Uninstalling a direct npm install (Method B)** has its own entry point, and it is *not* `scripts/uninstall.sh`. Deregister first, then remove the package:

```bash
# 1. every adapter you enabled, e.g. claude-code
bash ~/.local/share/anolisa/adapters/tokenless/claude-code/scripts/uninstall.sh
# 2. then the package itself
npm uninstall -g anolisa-tokenless
```

`scripts/uninstall.sh` is the **curl installer's** uninstaller (Method C). It is driven by the receipt at `~/.local/share/tokenless/install-receipt`, which only that installer writes, so on a direct npm install it stops immediately with `No install receipt found` and changes nothing. Use it only for a curl install.

Supported platforms:

| Platform | Architecture | npm package |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Linux (glibc) | x86_64 | `@anolisa/tokenless-linux-x64` |
| Linux (glibc) | aarch64 | `@anolisa/tokenless-linux-arm64` |
| macOS | x86_64 (Intel) | `@anolisa/tokenless-darwin-x64` — declared build target, **not published yet** |
| macOS | aarch64 (Apple Silicon) | `@anolisa/tokenless-darwin-arm64` |

`@anolisa/tokenless-darwin-x64` is a release build target only: it is not on the registry, so the npm route cannot deliver an Intel macOS binary. Method C cannot either — its source-build fallback is Linux-only, and `scripts/install.sh` exits with an error on macOS instead of running `cargo`. Until that package is published, Intel macOS has no supported install route; see [Platform support](#platform-support).

### Method C: curl standalone install

A one-liner install script that prefers npm and builds from source instead. The choice between the two is made **before** npm runs — when npm is missing, the platform is musl Linux, or you set `TOKENLESS_FORCE_BUILD=1`. Once `npm install` has been invoked the installer does **not** switch method automatically: npm's exit status cannot prove that its postinstall left no framework registration behind, so a failure at that stage is reported as an incomplete installation — keeping and naming whatever could not be rolled back — rather than as a successful source build. Re-run it, or build from source explicitly with `TOKENLESS_FORCE_BUILD=1`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/anolisa/main/src/tokenless/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Prerequisites depend on which path the script takes:

| Path | Taken when | Requires | Installs |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| npm | npm is present and the platform is glibc Linux or macOS | `curl`, `tar`, Node.js 16.7+ with `npm` | `tokenless`, `rtk`, and the adapter resources |
| Source build (Linux only) | chosen **before** npm runs: npm is missing, the platform is musl Linux, or `TOKENLESS_FORCE_BUILD=1`. Not selected automatically once `npm install` has been invoked — see the failure note above | `curl`, `tar`, a Rust toolchain (`cargo`) | the `tokenless` CLI only — no `rtk` and no adapters |

The script supports Linux and macOS only; on Windows it exits with an error, so use WSL2 there. Its source-build path is Linux-only as well: on macOS the installer either takes the npm path or exits with an error, and never invokes `cargo`.

Pin a version or set a custom install directory. Pass the variables to `bash`, not to `curl`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/anolisa/main/src/tokenless/scripts/install.sh | TOKENLESS_VERSION=0.7.4 bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/anolisa/main/src/tokenless/scripts/install.sh | TOKENLESS_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin bash
```

A pinned version is a hard pin: the source build downloads only the matching `tokenless/v<VERSION>` tag. If that tag does not exist the installer fails instead of silently building `main`.

The installer records what it created in `~/.local/share/tokenless/install-receipt`. To remove exactly those paths later:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alibaba/anolisa/main/src/tokenless/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
```

### Method D: Skill (for agents)

When an agent framework (cosh, OpenClaw, Hermes, etc.) needs to install and manage Tokenless on its own, use the Skill method.

The Skill file is at `src/os-skills/ai/install-tokenless/SKILL.md` in the repository. An agent that loads this file can complete installation and configuration automatically.

It is declared in the `os-skills` component manifest (`src/os-skills/component.toml`), so the next `os-skills` release ships it to `/usr/share/anolisa/skills/install-tokenless/` and `anolisa adapter enable os-skills openclaw` (or the `hermes` adapter) deploys it into that framework's skill directory. The distribution contract for the *currently published* `os-skills` artifact does not list it yet, and deliberately so: that contract is pinned by `index.toml` to one immutable artifact with a fixed sha256, so declaring a skill the artifact does not contain would make the bundle copy fail at enable time. It gains the skill together with the next version bump. Until then, load the Skill from its repository path.

To use it, point your agent framework at the Skill file path, or pass its contents directly to the agent. The Skill contains complete installation, verification, and framework integration guidance.

After installing Tokenless, enable the adapter for the target agent framework. The Skill guides this step automatically and follows whichever method it used, so apply the matching row of [Enable the adapter for your install method](#enable-the-adapter-for-your-install-method).

### Enable the adapter for your install method {#enable-the-adapter-for-your-install-method}

Installation only places files on disk; it does not register Tokenless with an agent. How you enable it depends on how you installed it:

| Install method | Adapter resources | How to enable |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| anolisa CLI (Method A) | installed with the component | `anolisa adapter scan`, then `anolisa adapter enable tokenless <framework>` |
| npm (Method B), or curl (Method C) through its npm path | copied by the package postinstall to `~/.local/share/anolisa/adapters/tokenless/` | run the framework's bundled script, for example `bash ~/.local/share/anolisa/adapters/tokenless/claude-code/scripts/install.sh`. `anolisa adapter enable` is unavailable here because an npm install creates no anolisa component record |
| curl (Method C) through its source-build path | none | not applicable — this is a CLI-only install. Use the `tokenless` subcommands directly, or reinstall through Method A or B for agent integration |
| Skill (Method D) | whichever method the Skill ran | follow that method's row |

Restart the agent CLI, IDE, or gateway after enabling.

## 2. Run one real task

Restart Claude Code so it loads the adapter, then start a new session and run a
tool-heavy task. For example:

> Run the full test suite for this repository and summarize only the failures.

You do not need to mention Tokenless in the prompt.

## 3. Verify the saving

After Claude Code uses a Shell, API, or another supported tool, run:

```bash
tokenless stats list --limit 5
tokenless stats summary
```

Example output (values vary by workload):

```text
Showing 1 record(s):
================================================================================
[ID:42] 2026-08-12 10:20:30 | claude-code | Session:- | Tool:- | Chars:5120→2880(-2240) | Tokens:1280→720(-44%)

Tokenless Statistics Summary
============================================================
Total Records: 1

Character Savings:
  Before: 5120 chars
  After:  2880 chars
  Saved:  2240 chars (43.8%)

Token Savings:
  Before: 1280 tokens
  After:  720 tokens
  Saved:  560 tokens (43.8%)

Breakdown by Operation:
----------------------------------------
  compress-response: 1 records
    Chars: 5120 -> 2880 (-43.8%)
    Tokens: 1280 -> 720 (-43.8%)
```

You are done when `stats list` contains a record whose estimated Token count
decreases from before to after. To inspect exactly what changed, copy its ID:

```bash
tokenless stats diff <record-id>
```

For a visual view of savings over time, follow the
[AgentSight guide](../../agent-observability/agentsight/integrations.md#tokenless-token-savings).
When Tokenless and AgentSight run as the same user, the Dashboard reads local
Tokenless statistics without requiring SLS.

If no record appears, the content may not have passed through Tokenless or may
not have become shorter. Check the adapter and component health:

```bash
anolisa adapter status tokenless
anolisa doctor tokenless
```

Then see
[No statistics appear after setup](troubleshooting.md#no-statistics-appear-after-enabling-the-adapter).

Token counts are estimates for content processed by Tokenless, not a direct
measurement of the model bill. Statistics and diffs may contain original tool
content; avoid sharing their output when it contains sensitive data. See
[Measuring savings](measuring-savings.md) and
[Configuration and data privacy](configuration-and-privacy.md) for details.

## Use another Agent

Scan the machine, then enable only the Agent you use:

```bash
anolisa adapter scan
```

| Agent | Setup |
|-------|-------|
| cosh / Copilot Shell | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless cosh` |
| OpenClaw | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless openclaw` |
| Hermes | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless hermes` |
| Qoder | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless qoder` |
| Claude Code | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless claude-code` |
| Codex | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless codex` |
| DeepSeek Harness (dsh) | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless dsh --profile <profile>` |
| OpenCode | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless opencode` |
| Qwen Code | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless qwencode` |
| QwenPaw | `anolisa adapter enable tokenless qwenpaw` |

Restart the Agent CLI or IDE after setting it up. OpenClaw also requires
`openclaw gateway restart`; if its security check rejects the plugin, follow
the [OpenClaw integration instructions](framework-integration.md#2-enable-one-adapter).
For DeepSeek Harness, `<profile>` is required and must match the name used by
`dsh --profile <profile>`; restart that profile after enabling the bundle.
To enable more than one profile, repeat `--profile` in the same command:

```bash
anolisa adapter enable tokenless dsh \
  --profile web \
  --profile headless
```

Every later enable or re-enable replaces the entire recorded profile set.
Include every profile that should retain Tokenless each time.

OpenCode is available through the same adapter command. The bundled lifecycle script remains an
alternative for npm installations that have no ANOLISA component record.

## Optional: test compression without an Agent

Use this deterministic check when you want to confirm the standalone CLI
before enabling an adapter:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"status":"ok","data":{"name":"demo","items":[1,2,3]},"debug":{"trace":"verbose"},"metadata":null}' \
  | tokenless compress-response

tokenless stats list --limit 1
```

The command returns valid JSON with `debug` and `metadata` omitted. Content
without removable fields is returned unchanged and is not recorded.

## Platform support

| Platform | anolisa CLI | npm | curl | Skill |
|----------|-------------|-----|------|-------|
| Linux x86_64/aarch64 (glibc) | Supported | Supported | Supported (npm path) | Supported (follows curl) |
| Linux with musl, such as Alpine | Not currently supported | Not currently supported | Source build only, needs a Rust toolchain | Source build only, needs a Rust toolchain |
| macOS Apple Silicon | Supported | Supported | Supported (npm path) | Supported (follows curl) |
| macOS x86_64 | Not currently supported | Not currently supported | Not currently supported | Not currently supported |
| Windows | Not currently supported | Not currently supported | Not supported, use WSL2 | Not supported, use WSL2 |

Notes on the boundaries above:

- macOS x86_64 has no supported route in this release. `@anolisa/tokenless-darwin-x64` is a release build target that is not on the registry, so neither npm nor the curl npm path can deliver a binary there, and the curl source-build fallback is refused on macOS — `scripts/install.sh` exits with an error instead of running `cargo`. Use Linux or Apple Silicon macOS until that package is published.
- curl on macOS relies on its npm path. Its source-build fallback is validated on Linux only, and the installer refuses to run it on macOS, so a macOS machine without npm has no supported curl path.
- The npm package declares `os: linux, darwin`, so Windows is unsupported by every method here. Inside WSL2 the Linux rows apply.
- The Skill method delegates to the anolisa CLI, npm, or curl, so its support follows the method it selects.
