# Agent Memory (agent-memory)

[中文版](../../zh/token-saving/agent-memory.md)

agent-memory is ANOLISA's file-form memory MCP server, providing AI agents with a persistent, searchable, sandboxed memory space. Agents read and write memory like a filesystem; the system injects relevant context into subsequent turns via BM25/vector hybrid retrieval and automatic capture/recall, reducing repeated communication and improving task continuity.

- **File-form memory**: read/write memory with filesystem semantics via MCP tools; namespace isolation and path sandboxing.
- **Hybrid semantic search**: BM25 + dense vector + RRF fusion with automatic fallback.
- **Auto capture & recall**: automatically extracts observations at conversation end (deduped) and injects relevant memory when building the next prompt.
- **Safe injection**: prompt-injection detection and escaping for memory content injected into LLM prompts.
- **Versioning & snapshots**: optional auto git commit + tar.gz snapshots for file-level and mount-level rollback.

Use Agent Memory when context must persist across sessions. Tokenless addresses
a different part of the workflow by compressing content that still needs to
enter the current context window.

## Requirements

- Linux on x86_64 or aarch64
- An Agent runtime that supports stdio MCP servers

---

## Installation

### Via anolisa CLI (recommended)

```bash
anolisa install agent-memory
```

Produces: `agent-memory` binary, default config, MCP service descriptor, systemd user template, tmpfiles rule, OpenClaw adapter bundle.

### RPM package (AnolisOS / RHEL)

```bash
sudo yum install agent-memory
```

RPM installs to system-level FHS paths:

| Purpose | Path |
|------|------|
| Service binary | `/usr/bin/agent-memory` |
| Default config | `/usr/share/anolisa/agent-memory/default.toml` |
| MCP service descriptor (auto-discovery) | `/usr/share/anolisa/mcp-servers/agent-memory.json` |
| systemd user template | `/usr/lib/systemd/user/anolisa-memory@.service` |
| tmpfiles rule (creates `/run/anolisa/{,sessions}`) | `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/anolisa-memory.conf` |
| OpenClaw adapter bundle | `/usr/share/anolisa/adapters/agent-memory/` |
| Docs | `/usr/share/doc/agent-memory/` |

### Source build (developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa.git
cd anolisa/src/agent-memory

make build         # cargo build --release --locked
sudo make install  # install to /usr/local
```

Build deps: Rust ≥ 1.85 (edition 2024; CI pins 1.89 to share the monorepo toolchain), cmake (libgit2 vendored), systemd-devel (journald audit fan-out).

### Cross-platform development

Runtime is Linux-only (depends on user_namespace, mount(2), cgroup v2, inotify, journald). On macOS / Windows use the remote flow:

```bash
make remote-build   # push branch and ssh to a Linux host for cargo build
make remote-test    # same + tests + clippy
```

## Integration

### Claude Code / Cursor / Continue / any stdio MCP client

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-memory": {
      "command": "/usr/bin/agent-memory",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "USER_ID": "alice",
        "MEMORY_PROFILE": "advanced"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`/usr/share/anolisa/mcp-servers/agent-memory.json` lists all 37 tool names for auto-discovering clients.

### OpenClaw

The bundled plugin forwards 4 memory-contract tools (`anolisa_memory_search`, `anolisa_memory_get`, `memory_observe`, `memory_get_context`) to agent-memory:

```bash
bash /usr/share/anolisa/adapters/agent-memory/openclaw/scripts/install.sh
openclaw gateway restart
```

Or via anolisa adapter management:

```bash
anolisa adapter enable agent-memory openclaw
anolisa adapter status agent-memory
```

**Prerequisite**: `openclaw` CLI on `$PATH`. The script logs clearly and exits 0 if missing — rerun after installing OpenClaw. `yum remove agent-memory` triggers `%preun` to call the uninstall script, leaving no orphaned config.

Running `anolisa adapter enable agent-memory openclaw` or the agent-memory OpenClaw `install.sh` accepts the plugin's declared capabilities. Both entry points pass `--accept-capabilities` only when `plugins install --help` advertises that exact option, so older hosts keep working. Set `AGENT_MEMORY_ACCEPT_CAPABILITIES=0` when running `install.sh` to withhold consent — gating hosts then reject the install until you grant it yourself, e.g. via an interactive `openclaw plugins install`.

Install-time environment variables (runtime `MEMORY_*` variables are listed separately under Environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_MEMORY_ACCEPT_CAPABILITIES` | accept | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` grant consent when the host advertises the flag; `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` withhold it, so gating hosts reject the install; any other value aborts with an error (exit code 2) before install |
| `AGENT_MEMORY_SAFE_INSTALL` | unset | `1` declines `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` on hosts that would still receive it; hosts advertising it as a deprecated no-op omit it either way |
| `OPENCLAW_BIN` | `openclaw` | openclaw CLI binary to invoke |
| `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` | `~/.openclaw` | state directory passed to every openclaw CLI invocation |
| `OPENCLAW_HOME` | `~/.openclaw` | default for `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` only; never passed to the CLI (unset for every call) |

The standalone `install.sh` negotiates the unsafe-install bypass the same way: it passes `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` only while the installer advertises that option as effective. OpenClaw 2026.6.1 and earlier run an install-time safety scan that blocks `child_process` plugins non-interactively — this plugin spawns the agent-memory MCP server over stdio — so those hosts receive the bypass. OpenClaw 2026.6.5 and later dropped install-time dangerous-code blocking and list the option as a deprecated no-op, so they never receive it; there install-time safety is decided by the operator-owned `security.installPolicy`, which no script flag can override. `AGENT_MEMORY_SAFE_INSTALL=1` declines the bypass on hosts where it still has effect and changes nothing on current ones — the install log states which case applied. If the `plugins install --help` probe itself fails, the host cannot be classified: the script keeps the bypass so pre-2026.6.2 hosts still install, logs a WARNING, and `AGENT_MEMORY_SAFE_INSTALL=1` declines it there too.

When an install fails, the script reports only what it can verify. An unwritable `${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/extensions` is named as the filesystem-permission failure that on its own would break the install — fix that directory, and do not touch the policy for it. Otherwise the `openclaw` output above the script's note is the evidence, and `security.installPolicy` appears only as a conditional to confirm there, never as an asserted cause: a host that advertises the bypass as a deprecated no-op says nothing about why an install failed.

The OpenClaw plugin exposes `anolisa_memory_search` and `anolisa_memory_get` for
ANOLISA memories. OpenClaw's `memory_search` and `memory_get` remain host tools;
the namespaced tools do not compete for those names. Both `install.sh` and
`anolisa adapter enable agent-memory openclaw` install the same plugin bundle.
The scripts no longer explicitly disable or re-enable `memory-core`. OpenClaw
still manages its memory slot and plugin loading according to its own configuration.

When upgrading, update prompts, skills, tool allowlists and direct callers that
used the plugin's old `memory_search` / `memory_get` names. There are no old-name
aliases; restart the gateway and start a new conversation so its tool list and
memory instructions use the new names. Internal MCP names and stored memories
are unchanged.

The plugin declares all four contract tools for the `coding` profile through
its manifest's `toolMetadata`. OpenClaw 2026.9.2 conversation tool resolution
honors this declaration, so both installation paths expose search, read,
observe, and context tools without modifying your tool policy. Explicit
allow/deny restrictions still apply.
`group:memory` expands only to OpenClaw's `memory_search` and `memory_get`; it
does not include the ANOLISA names.

Profile metadata support is not an installation requirement: older hosts can
use explicit tool grants. OpenClaw 2026.5.7 does not honor
`toolMetadata.profiles`; automatic profile contributions are
verified separately on 2026.9.2. For a host or tool surface that does not honor
this metadata, add `anolisa_memory_search`, `anolisa_memory_get`, `memory_observe`,
and `memory_get_context` to the effective `tools.alsoAllow`
(or the corresponding agent/provider policy). Merge these entries into your
existing list rather than replacing it. For example, when no list exists:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "profile": "coding",
    "alsoAllow": [
      "anolisa_memory_search",
      "anolisa_memory_get",
      "memory_observe",
      "memory_get_context"
    ]
  }
}
```

Sandbox sessions have an additional policy: the default sandbox does not allow
memory tools, including the old names. If you intend to allow ANOLISA search/read
there, also add the two new names to `tools.sandbox.tools.alsoAllow` (or the
agent's sandbox policy). An existing sandbox `allow: ["group:memory"]` needs this
addition too. Add `memory_observe` and `memory_get_context` there only if those
capabilities are intended as well. Keep explicit deny rules and other
agent/provider restrictions;
`alsoAllow` does not override a deny. Installers do not grant these permissions.
Restart the gateway and start a new conversation after editing the policy.

If an earlier installer left
`${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/.anolisa-memory-anolisa-disabled-memory-core`, the scripts
warn and retain it for manual recovery. Inspect `plugins.slots.memory` and
`plugins.entries.memory-core.enabled` first. To allow the bundled sidecar while
keeping your current slot, set `plugins.entries.memory-core.enabled` to `true`
with `openclaw config set`, then restart the gateway; host policy and version
still determine whether the sidecar loads. To select `memory-core` as the active
backend after removing this plugin, use `openclaw plugins enable memory-core`.
That command changes the memory slot, so do not use it if you want to keep
`memory-anolisa`, another backend, or `none`. Remove the marker only after you
have confirmed the desired state, including an intentional choice to keep
`memory-core` disabled. The new tools work without restoring it.

Plugin contract ↔ agent-memory MCP tool mapping:

| OpenClaw contract | agent-memory MCP tool |
|---|---|
| `anolisa_memory_search` | `memory_search` (BM25 default; `mode=vector\|hybrid` with embedding) |
| `anolisa_memory_get` | `mem_read` |
| `memory_observe` | `memory_observe` |
| `memory_get_context` | `memory_get_context` |

Plugin config (via OpenClaw UI or `openclaw.json` `plugins.entries["memory-anolisa"].config`):

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `binaryPath` | auto-discovery: `$PATH` → `/usr/bin/agent-memory` → `/usr/local/bin/agent-memory` → `~/.local/bin/agent-memory` | absolute binary path |
| `userId` | env `USER_ID` → OS `uid` → env `$USER` | namespace `user_id`; same validation as Rust side |
| `profile` | `advanced` | profile gate, passed as `MEMORY_PROFILE` env; `basic` or `advanced` only — the plugin rejects `expert` at load (see Profiles below) |
| `maxReadBytes` | `1048576` (1 MiB) | `mem_read` cap, passed as `MEMORY_MAX_READ_BYTES` |
| `maxWriteBytes` | `16777216` (16 MiB) | `mem_write` cap, passed as `MEMORY_MAX_WRITE_BYTES` |
| `sessionId` | env `MEMORY_SESSION_ID` → new `ses_<random>` | namespace session; must be fixed |
| `sessionDir` | env `MEMORY_SESSION_DIR` → `/run/anolisa/sessions` | session scratch + log root |

The plugin passes a minimal env allowlist to the subprocess (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `USER_ID`, `LANG`/`LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE`, `TZ`, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and all `MEMORY_`/`RUST_`-prefixed vars); other env does not leak. `USER_ID` matches exactly — `USER_IDX` is not allowed.

## MCP tool set (37 tools)

All tools are invoked via MCP `tools/call` with JSON object arguments. Errors return `CallToolResult { isError: true }` so clients can distinguish business errors from "successful but content contains 'failed'". Profile is enforced at both `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

## Core features

### File-form memory

Agents organize memory by path, matching the human filesystem model:

```
notes/day1.md
decisions/2026-05/db-pick.md
context/project-overview.md
```

Namespace layout:

```
~/.anolisa/memory/user-<uid>/        # mount root
├── README.md                        # auto-generated overview
├── notes/                           # free-form notes
├── decisions/                       # user-defined subdirs
└── .anolisa/                        # OS-managed, not writable by agents
    ├── manifest.toml                # namespace metadata
    ├── audit.log                    # JSONL tool-call audit
    ├── index.db                     # FTS5 SQLite
    ├── snapshots/                   # tar.gz archives + sidecar
    ├── trash/                       # entries retained on restore
    └── git/                         # bare git mirror (when git enabled)
```

Session dir (tmpfs, 0700):

```
/run/anolisa/sessions/<sid>/
├── meta.toml
├── log.jsonl
└── scratch/                         # session-only drafts; promoted via mem_promote
```

### Sandbox protection

Every file open is anchored at the mount root via kernel `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS)`:

- Rejects `..` traversal
- Rejects symlinks (including mid-call replacement; recursive deletes use `fdopendir` + `fstatat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)` + `unlinkat` so swaps can't race)
- Rejects access to metadata dirs (`.anolisa`, `.git`, `.gitignore` via `TargetIsReserved`)
- `mem_snapshot_restore` filters tar entry types — rejects `Symlink`/`Hardlink`/`Device`/`Fifo`
- Oversized payloads rejected per `max_*_bytes`

**Mount strategies**:

| Strategy | When | Behavior |
|------|------|------|
| `userland` (default) | any environment | mount is just a directory; sandbox enforced by `openat2` |
| `userns` | Linux ≥ 4.6 with unprivileged user namespace | `unshare` into a new user+mount namespace, mount a private tmpfs, then bind-mount the backing dir; host-side processes can't see `/mnt/memory/<ns>/` |
| `auto` | runtime probe | try `userns`; fall back to `userland` on any error |

### Version control

Optional auto git commit (libgit2 vendored):

```bash
MEMORY_GIT_ENABLED=true MEMORY_GIT_AUTO_COMMIT=true agent-memory
```

With git on, `mem_log` exposes change history and `mem_revert` gives the agent a real "undo" button. `mem_snapshot*` provides mount-wide tar.gz point-in-time backups independent of git.

### Full-text search

SQLite FTS5 BM25 index, sub-millisecond queries. A background tokio task watches the mount via `inotify`; events are debounced 200 ms and applied in a single transaction. Tokenizer is `trigram` (substring matching for ≥3-char terms). The trigram tokenizer emits one token per 3-character window, so a query term shorter than 3 characters (common for CJK words like "花名" / "小云") produces no tokens and would silently match nothing; `memory_search` detects this case and falls back to a `body LIKE '%term%'` substring scan so short CJK queries still recall. `IN_Q_OVERFLOW` triggers a full rescan — events are never silently dropped.

### Hybrid vector search

BM25 + dense vector hybrid retrieval, fused via RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, k=60). Vectors come from a pluggable Embedding Provider:

| Provider | Configuration | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|
| OpenAI | `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BACKEND=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` | calls OpenAI Embeddings API |
| Ollama | `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BACKEND=ollama` + `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | local Ollama instance |

`memory_search` supports `mode`: `bm25` (default) / `vector` (cosine similarity) / `hybrid` (RRF fusion). Without embedding config, `vector`/`hybrid` auto-degrade to BM25 — no error.

### Auto consolidation

On shutdown, automatically extracts atomic facts from the session audit log (`mem_consolidate`) using 6 heuristic rules (zero LLM calls) — identifies high-frequency paths, search patterns, etc., and persists them as structured memory. Also manually triggerable via the `mem_consolidate` tool. Includes episodic memory extraction and conflict detection (BM25 threshold).

### Audit & observability

Every successful tool call appends a JSONL line to `<mount>/.anolisa/audit.log`; with sessions enabled, also to `/run/anolisa/sessions/<sid>/log.jsonl`. `audit.journald=true` fans out to systemd-journald with structured fields (`MESSAGE_ID`, `AGENT_MEMORY_TOOL`, etc.) for `journalctl --user-unit=anolisa-memory@<user>` filtering.

---

## Configuration

### Config file

Default location: `~/.anolisa/memory.toml`. The file is optional; Agent Memory
uses built-in defaults when it is absent. All structs enable
`serde(deny_unknown_fields)` — typos hard-fail at load. Minimal config:

```toml
[global]
user_id = "alice"

[memory]
profile = "advanced"           # basic | advanced | expert
max_read_bytes = 1048576       # 1 MiB
max_write_bytes = 16777216     # 16 MiB
max_append_bytes = 4194304     # 4 MiB

[memory.paths]
base_dir = "~/.anolisa/memory"

[memory.session]
base_dir = "/run/anolisa/sessions"
end_action = "discard"         # discard | keep

[memory.mount]
strategy = "auto"              # auto | userland | userns

[memory.index]
enabled = true
time_decay_lambda = 0.01
time_decay_alpha = 0.3
cold_after_days = 30
exclude_cold_on_search = true

[memory.audit]
journald = false

[memory.cgroup]
enabled = false
memory_max = "512M"

[memory.git]
enabled = false
auto_commit = true

[memory.consolidation]
enabled = true
max_facts = 20
min_tool_calls = 3
episodic_enabled = true
min_episode_steps = 3
max_episodes_per_session = 10
conflict_detection = true
conflict_bm25_threshold = -2.0
```

### Environment variables

Every config key has a matching `MEMORY_*` env var. Priority: **env > config.toml > default**.

| `MEMORY_CONFLICT_DETECTION` | conflict detection | true |
| `MEMORY_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD` | BM25 conflict threshold | -2.0 |

Data storage: `~/.anolisa/memory/<namespace>/`.

### Profiles

Profiles are UX hints, not security boundaries, but enforced at both `tools/list` and `tools/call`:

- **basic** — all 37 tools shown; weaker models can use the Tier B structured API.
- **advanced** (default) — all 37 tools shown; stronger models should prefer Tier A file ops.
- **expert** — hides Tier B (`memory_search`, `memory_observe`, `memory_get_context`, `mem_consolidate`, `memory_forget`, `memory_consent`); `tools/call` returns `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`. For proficient models that only need Tier A and Tier C.

`expert` is a setting for direct MCP clients, which drive the Tier A file tools
themselves. The OpenClaw adapter rejects
`plugins.entries["memory-anolisa"].config.profile = "expert"` when the plugin
loads: three of the four tools it registers for the host's memory contract
(`anolisa_memory_search` → `memory_search`, `memory_observe`, `memory_get_context`)
use Tier B MCP methods, and so do
the two paths that call `memory_search` on the agent's behalf — auto-recall
before each prompt and the `corpus=all` supplement. Forwarding the profile would
leave the memory slot loaded while every one of those calls came back
`METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, so the adapter fails at boot and says why instead.

### Embedding config

```toml

## Use cases

- Cross-session persistence of notes and decisions (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, custom rmcp clients).
- Multi-agent systems where Agent A writes and Agent B reads shared notes.
- Operation audit and state recovery (`mem_log`, JSONL audit, journald, `mem_revert`, `mem_snapshot_restore`).
- Multi-turn "draft first, persist when decided" pattern (`mem_promote` atomically moves files from session scratch into the persistent store).

## SDK / client integration

### Python (official `mcp` SDK)

```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def main():
    server = StdioServerParameters(
        command="/usr/bin/agent-memory", args=[],
        env={"USER_ID": "alice"},
    )
    async with stdio_client(server) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            print([t.name for t in tools.tools])
            result = await session.call_tool(
                "mem_write",
                {"path": "notes/from-python.md", "content": "hello"},
            )
            assert not result.isError

asyncio.run(main())
```

### TypeScript (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "/usr/bin/agent-memory", args: [],
  env: { USER_ID: "alice" },
});
const client = new Client({ name: "my-app", version: "1.0.0" }, {});
await client.connect(transport);
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "mem_grep",
  arguments: { pattern: "TODO", recursive: true, max: 50 },
});
```

### Rust (`rmcp`)

```rust
use rmcp::transport::child_process::ChildProcessTransport;
use rmcp::ServiceExt;

let transport = ChildProcessTransport::new(
    tokio::process::Command::new("/usr/bin/agent-memory"),
).await?;
let client = ().serve(transport).await?;
let tools = client.list_tools(Default::default()).await?;
```

### Promote workflow (multi-turn)

1. Set `MEMORY_SESSION_ID=<sid>` and `MEMORY_SESSION_DIR=/run/anolisa/sessions` for each agent run.
2. Agent writes drafts to `/run/anolisa/sessions/<sid>/scratch/`.
3. When a draft is worth keeping, the agent calls `mem_promote` to atomically move it into the persistent store.

## Testing & verification

### Automated tests

```bash
cd src/agent-memory
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test                              # full suite
cargo test --test e2e_agent_test        # tool E2E
cargo test --test mcp_integration_test  # protocol layer
cargo test --test linux_userns_test -- --ignored  # needs unprivileged userns
make smoke                              # one-shot end-to-end smoke
```

CI runs `fmt --check` + `clippy -D warnings` + `cargo test` on Rust 1.89.

### Interactive `mcp-harness`

```bash
cargo run --example mcp-harness -- /tmp/mem-test
```

| Command | Description |
|------|------|
| `list` | list visible tools |
| `call <tool> <json_args>` | invoke a tool |
| `help` | help |
| `quit` | quit |

Scenarios: `--scenario full` / `git --git` / `promote` / `--verbose` (prints JSON-RPC).

### Raw JSON-RPC (protocol-level debugging)

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/mem-test/__sessions__
MEMORY_BASE_DIR=/tmp/mem-test \
MEMORY_SESSION_DIR=/tmp/mem-test/__sessions__ \
MEMORY_MOUNT_STRATEGY=userland \
USER_ID=tester \
agent-memory
```

Handshake + tool call:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"manual","version":"1.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"mem_write","arguments":{"path":"test.md","content":"hello"}}}
```

### Sandbox escape verification

```json
{"name":"mem_read","arguments":{"path":"../../etc/passwd"}}
```
→ `isError: true`, message `path outside mount root`.

```json
{"name":"mem_write","arguments":{"path":".anolisa/audit.log","content":"x"}}
```
→ `isError: true`, message `target is reserved`.

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnostic tools

```bash
# Component-level diagnosis (follow the reported fix plan manually)
anolisa doctor agent-memory

# Adapter status
anolisa adapter status agent-memory

# Debug startup
RUST_LOG=agent_memory=debug agent-memory
```

### Common issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|------|----------|------|
| startup `unshare(NEWUSER\|NEWNS): EPERM` | unprivileged user namespace disabled | `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`, or `MEMORY_MOUNT_STRATEGY=userland` |
| `tmpfs /mnt: EBUSY` | `/mnt` occupied in new namespace | restart the process |
| macOS / Windows `cargo build` fails on `libsystemd`/`nix` | non-Linux host | `make remote-build` / `remote-test` |
| `tools/call memory_search` returns `METHOD_NOT_FOUND` | `MEMORY_PROFILE=expert` hides Tier B | switch to `advanced`, or use Tier A directly |
| config typos silently ignored | — | now hard-fail; check startup stderr |
| `mem_log` returns `[]` despite writes | git versioning not enabled | `MEMORY_GIT_ENABLED=true MEMORY_GIT_AUTO_COMMIT=true` |
| search misses just-written content | inside the 200 ms debounce window | retry, or use `mem_grep` (regex on the filesystem, no index) |
| `mem_promote` reports `session not found` | `MEMORY_SESSION_ID`/`MEMORY_SESSION_DIR` unset or scratch missing | see Promote workflow |
| OpenClaw plugin not loaded | `openclaw` CLI not on PATH | rerun `install.sh` after installing OpenClaw |
| OpenClaw calls the host memory backend or reports `plugin tool name conflict` | Old plugin bundle, stale gateway/session, or old tool names in prompts | Update the plugin, restart the gateway, start a new session, and use `anolisa_memory_search` / `anolisa_memory_get` for ANOLISA memories |
| install.sh reports `Plugin "memory-anolisa" requires capability consent` | OpenClaw >= 2026.8.1 consent gate; installer-options probe failed, `AGENT_MEMORY_ACCEPT_CAPABILITIES=0` is set, or script predates the fix | check install output for the probe WARNING or opt-out refusal line; update agent-memory, unset the opt-out, or run `openclaw plugins install <plugin-dir> --force --accept-capabilities` manually. A withheld install rejected by the gate exits with code 3; if OpenClaw rewords the rejection message, the script falls back to exit 1 with the opt-out note |
| install.sh reports the install target is not writable | `${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR}/extensions` (or its nearest existing parent) is not writable by the user running the script, so OpenClaw's `mkdir extensions/memory-anolisa` fails with `EACCES` | fix that directory's ownership/permissions — or point `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` at a writable state directory — and re-run. This is a filesystem failure, not a policy refusal: do not relax `security.installPolicy` for it |
| install.sh fails on a host that lists `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` as a deprecated no-op | OpenClaw 2026.6.5+ runs no install-time scan, so the script sent no bypass and cannot shape install-time safety there; the cause is in the `openclaw` output | read the CLI output above the script's note. Only if it names `security.installPolicy` is that operator-owned policy what to relax — re-running the script or setting `AGENT_MEMORY_SAFE_INSTALL` cannot override it |
| install.sh reports the safety scan blocked the plugin | OpenClaw 2026.6.1 or earlier scans plugin sources at install time and flags the plugin's `child_process.spawn` MCP transport | unset `AGENT_MEMORY_SAFE_INSTALL` so the script passes the bypass it declined, or upgrade OpenClaw |
| system state out of sync after manual dnf | — | `sudo anolisa --install-mode system repair agent-memory`; use system-scoped `forget` / `adopt` only when intentionally rebuilding the record for a present RPM |

For deeper investigation: start with `RUST_LOG=agent_memory=debug` and inspect both stderr and `<mount>/.anolisa/audit.log`.
