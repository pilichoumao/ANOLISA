//! Adapter receipt schema (`AdapterClaim`) and its security-boundary
//! [`ClaimResource`] model.
//!
//! A receipt is **pure data**: it records what a framework driver took
//! over on behalf of one component, so [`status`](super::manager) and
//! [`disable`](super::manager) can run later without re-reading the
//! resource directory and without trusting any executable instruction
//! from disk. Receipts never carry executable argv, script paths, or reverse
//! commands. [`AdapterNotice::command`](crate::manifest::AdapterNotice::command)
//! is the sole command-like string: an inert display hint that must never be
//! parsed into argv or executed. Framework CLI invocations are constructed by
//! built-in drivers, not read back from receipts.
//!
//! Every value that `status`/`disable` would interpret as a path, a
//! symlink, or a framework-registry entry must live in [`ClaimResource`],
//! the closed set the Manager re-validates before handing the claim to a
//! driver. The framework-specific [`DriverPayload`] may only hold typed
//! data the driver needs to *understand* the receipt; it is never a path
//! safety boundary and must reference paths by [`ClaimResource::id`]
//! rather than duplicating them.
//!
//! Wire format note: the enums here are **externally tagged** (serde
//! default, no `#[serde(flatten)]`). `toml` 0.8 mis-serializes
//! internally-tagged enums combined with `flatten`; externally-tagged
//! variants round-trip cleanly as long as scalar fields are declared
//! before nested tables/arrays. The round-trip is pinned by the
//! `adapter_claim_toml_round_trip` test.
